# Summary 
This application was an opportunity to become familiar and comfortable with using open source API. This was my first interaction with API requests for which I was using Axios. 
I was using React and React Bootstrap to display a table of characters from Star Wars and their associated info. You can navigate through the list of characters by using the Next and Prev buttons, or search for your favorite character(s) using the search bar. The final application is hosted on Heroku.
